An experimental PE analyser

A REALLY experimental PE analyser.

OK. It's really just a fun little project to teach myself about PE files.
Don't expect there to be anything useul in here and DEFINITELY don't think that this is the correct way to read a PE file.
I am just going off the documentation and making assumptions where there really isn't much info.

Also I would like to license this under the GPL-V3 but since I'm using the names of variables and stuctures from the Microsoft documentation I'm not sure if that is a problem.
If someone knows if I can't license this under the GPL because of this PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
